		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This heavy rich recipe is best enjoyed right from the oven and taken in modest amounts. The effort involved isn't too complex but it will take some time. Serve for a group for best results.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<h3>Eggplant</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>black pepper (freshly ground)</li>
			<li>2 medium eggplants (2-1/2 pounds)</li>
			<li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>5 large eggs</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons whole milk</li>
			<li>4 cups Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
			<li>1-1/2 to 2 cups vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Parmesan (grated)</li>
			<li>1 pound provolone cheese (grated)</li>
			<li>1-1/2 pounds mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>2 handfuls of fresh basil (torn)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sauce</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>kosher salt</li>
			<li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
			<li>6 garlic cloves</li>
			<li>4 medium yellow onions</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
			<li>3 cans (28 ounces) whole plum tomatoes</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<h3>Eggplant</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Wash and cut the eggplant into 1/2 inch thick rounds.</li>
			<li>Arrange the eggplant rounds in a single layer on two baking sheets.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle with salt on both sides of each slice and allow to sit for about 1 hour (salting it draws out the liquid and bitter flavor).</li>
			<li>After an hour, rinse with cold water and dry them thoroughly with a kitchen towel.</li>
			<li>Put the flour in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>In a third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with the oregano and fresh thyme leaves and season with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>Dip each eggplant slice in the flour and shake off any excess.</li>
			<li>Then, dip in the egg mixture, and finally in the breadcrumbs (make sure to coat both sides of each slice of eggplant).</li>
			<li>Arrange them in single layers on the baking sheets.</li>
			<li>In a large skillet, pour enough oil to accumulate about 1/2 inch in the bottom.</li>
			<li>Heat the oil until it begins to smoke lightly (alternatively, test with a thermometer and wait until the oil registers between 380⁰ F and 400⁰ F).</li>
			<li>Use a pair of kitchen tongs to add a single layer of the eggplant to the pan.</li>
			<li>Cook them until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.</li>
			<li>Remove from the oil and transfer to a baking sheet fitted with paper towel so the eggplant can drain as the others cook (alternatively, use a cooling rack).</li>
			<li>Season lightly with salt.</li>
			<li>Take care to reheat the oil back up to temperature before adding another batch of slices to the pan.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Sauce</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
			<li>Peel, halve, and cut the onion into thin slices.</li>
			<li>Peel and grate the garlic cloves.</li>
			<li>Add the onion and garlic, season with salt and red pepper flakes.</li>
			<li>Cook until the onions become translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add the sugar and the canned tomatoes.</li>
			<li>Use a wooden spoon to break up some of the whole tomatoes and cook 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring from time to time.</li>
			<li>Taste for seasoning, the tomatoes should be fairly broken down and the flavors coming together.</li>
			<li>Cook for another few minutes if the tomatoes still taste like they need a little more time to break down.</li>
			<li>Set aside to cool.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Eggplant and Sauce</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut the mozzarella into thin slices.</li>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350⁰ F.</li>
			<li>In a 9 by 13 inch flameproof baking dish, spoon about 1/4 of the tomato sauce on the bottom.</li>
			<li>Top with a layer of the fried eggplant (the eggplant slices can overlap slightly).</li>
			<li>Top with about 1/3 of the mozzarella slices.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle with about 1/4 of the Parmesan and provolone cheeses.</li>
			<li>Top with a layer of torn basil leaves.</li>
			<li>Spoon sauce and repeat the layering two more times to make three layers.</li>
			<li>End with the remaining mozzarella.</li>
			<li>Carefully press the layers down firmly into the dish once assembled.</li>
			<li>Place the dish on the top rack of the oven and cook until the cheese is melted and bubbly (35 to 40 minutes).</li>
			<li>For extra browning, put the dish under the broiler for a minute or two just before serving to get an extra brown cheesy top.</li>
		</ol>
