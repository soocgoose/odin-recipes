This is a version of [Recipes from The Odin Project][recipes project]. The code will initially focus on demonstrating usage of the material covered in the [foundations course][odin foundation].

## Organization

1. The "recipe" class is used to signal the presence of a necessary recipe part. Each recipe is required to have some set of "contents" and "process" as well as a single "title" (ideally unique but not required).
2. A recipe may nest other recipes but doesn't guarantee that all parts are accounted for.
3. A recipe "collection" is what provides that guarantee.
4. Finally, a recipe "cover" is typically a superfluous piece of related content that provides motivation.
